**Technical Assignment | Automated Dashboard (DATA CHAMPION)**

1. In this assignment I have automated a dashboard using spreadsheet formulae and used Conditional Formatting. 
2. Using conditional formating I have highlighted students into 3 categories based on their percentiles. 
3. Green -: top students with percentiles >=0.8 , yellow -: average students with percentiles < 0.8 & >=0.5 and Red -: poor students with percentiles <0.5
4. I have added percentiles , rank columns along with their personas according to their performance in both BASIC and  ADVANCED rounds and at last given feedbacks to each one of them according to their personas. 
5. In this way , it will be fair for students to not be judged by marks and the company can also recruit those students with skills and good personas and not just by marks which can be deceptive. 
6. I have used 2 datasets BASIC SCREENING and ADVANCED SCREENING along with their KEYS to complete my task, which was provided through DEEP THOUGHT itself.
